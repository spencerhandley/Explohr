Express State Change History
============================

1.1.4 (2014-04-03)
------------------

* Fixed issue where pre-serialized values from a parent `Exposed` object were
  being used instead of an `Exposed` object's own values. The process of getting
  a serialized value for a given namespace has been improved to properly follow
  the semantics of `Exposed` object hierarchy. ([#25][])

    ```javascript
    app.expose(1, 'foo', {cache: true});
    res.expose(2, 'foo');
    ```

  The above now results in the following, as expected:

    ```javascript
    console.log(window.foo); // => 2
    ```

1.1.3 (2014-03-06)
------------------

* Fixed issue where an error would be thrown when evaluating the JavaScript
  output of exposed data with deep namespaces. ([#23][] @jeremyruppel)

  The following will no longer throw an error when its output is evaluated in
  the browser:

    ```javascript
    app.expose({}, 'foo');
    app.expose('baz', 'foo.bar.baz');
    ```

  Previously, this would output the following and throw because `root.foo.bar`
  was `undefined`:

    ```javascript
    root.foo || (root.foo = {});
    root.foo.bar || (root.foo.bar = {});

    root.foo = {};
    root.foo.bar.baz = "baz";
    ```

  Now, the namespaces are initialized next to where data will be assigned to
  them and now outputs the following:

    ```javascript
    root.foo = {};
    root.foo || (root.foo = {});
    root.foo.bar || (root.foo.bar = {});
    root.foo.bar.baz = "baz";
    ```

1.1.2 (2014-02-21)
------------------

* Fixed issue with line terminator characters (`U+2028` and `U+2029`) being
  handled differently in JavaScript vs. JSON by escaping them.

1.1.1 (2014-01-25)
------------------

* Made request-scope exposed data *always* inherit the app-scope exposed data.
  With this change if a request comes in before data is exposed at the
  app-scope, the `app.locals.state` object will be created first. This ensures
  the semantics of the relationship between app- and request-scoped exposed
  data. ([#20][])

1.1.0 (2014-01-22)
------------------

* __[!]__ Deprecated `expose( obj, namespace, local )` API signature, the third
  argument is now `options`, use: `expose( obj, namespace, {local: local})`. The
  deprecated signature will be removed in a future release, and logs a warning
  when it is used.

* Added `{cache: true}` option that signals Express State to eagerly serialize
  unchanging data and reuse the result to *greatly* improve performance of
  repeated `toString()` calls ([#19][]).

* Fixed issue with `app` <-- `res` exposed data inheritance. Previously, the
  exposed data a `res` would inherit from the `app` was locked to the state of
  the exposed app-scope data at the time of the request. Now, if new data is
  exposed at the app-scope during a request, it's properly inherited by the
  request-scoped data.

* Added benchmark tests. They can be run using: `npm run benchmark`. Real world
  fixture data is used from Photos Near Me and Yahoo Tech.

* Tweaked `toString()` serialization process to gather low-hanging performance
  fruit ([#18][]).

1.0.3 (2013-12-04)
------------------

* Fixed `npm test` script so it runs on Windows. ([#17][])

* Added `.npmignore` file. ([#15][])

* Tweaked closure that's wrapped around the serialized data and namespace
  initialization. There's no affect on app code, this is merely renaming a local
  variable from `g` to `root` which is the reference to the root or global
  object that the namespaces hang off of.

1.0.2 (2013-11-05)
------------------

* Updated object branding used by `extend()` to assign the module's `export`
  object as the value of the "branding". This makes it easier compare and
  determine _which_ Express State module instance was used to extend the Express
  app. ([#14][])

* Added "modown" keyword to package.json. ([#16][])

1.0.1 (2013-10-16)
------------------

* __[!]__ Unsafe HTML characters in string values are now encoded to their
  Unicode counterparts during serialization to protected against XSS attacks.
  The encoded characters will `===` the non-encoded characters so there's no
  worry of this messing up application code. While this change makes Express
  State safer, **untrusted user input should always be escaped!** ([#11][])

* Added "Untrusted User Input" and "Exposing Functions" sections to the README.
  ([#12][])

* Improved README docs to be clearer and better organized. ([#10][]: @zhouyaoji)

1.0.0 (2013-08-15)
------------------

* __[!]__ Changed how this package extends Express. There's now _only_ one way â€”
  to explicitly pass an Express app instance to the `extend()` method:

    ```javascript
    var express  = require('express'),
        expstate = require('express-state'),

        app = express();

    // Extend the Express app with Express State's functionality.
    expstate.extend(app);
    ```

  This new `extend()` implementation uses the
  [object branding technique](https://gist.github.com/ericf/6133744). ([#6][])

* A `TypeError` is now thrown when trying to serialize native build-in
  functions. This matches the behavior of `JSON.stringify()` with circular
  references. ([#7][])

* Added documentation in README.md. ([#2][])

0.0.4 (2013-07-29)
------------------

* Added `extend()` function which takes an `express` module instance and adds
  the `expose()` method to its application and response prototypes, if it does
  not already exist. ([#5][])

* Added `augment()` function which takes an Express app instance and adds the
  `expose()` method to it and its response prototype, if it does not already
  exist. ([#5][])


[#5]: https://github.com/yahoo/express-state/issues/5


0.0.3 (2013-06-08)
------------------

* Prevented multiple copies of `express-state` from overwriting `expose()` when
  it already has been plugged into a copy of `express`. ([#4][])

* Added Screwdriver CI integration.


[#4]: https://github.com/yahoo/express-state/issues/4


0.0.2 (2013-05-03)
------------------

* Added Travis CI integration.

* Improved namespace rendering by removing the initialization of leaf namespaces
  since exposed values will be assigned to them. ([#1][])

0.0.1 (2013-05-02)
------------------

* Initial release.
